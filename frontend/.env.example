# Frontend Environment Variables (.env)
# 
# This file contains non-sensitive configuration for the React frontend.
# It defines where the frontend should send API requests.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env (remove .example) in the frontend/ directory
# 2. Update VITE_API_URL with your backend server URL:
#    - Local development: http://localhost:8000
#    - Production: Your production backend URL (e.g., https://your-backend-domain.nip.io:8000)
# 3. Keep .env in the .gitignore to prevent committing environment-specific values
# 4. This file is safe to commit if you remove sensitive values (frontend doesn't use keys)
#
# For local development:
#   npm run dev will use http://localhost:8000 by default if VITE_API_URL is not set

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
